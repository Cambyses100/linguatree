                <p>No matter what reasons you have to be interested in learning Brazilian Portuguese, I am happy to help you. I work with a range of textbooks, audio materials, and carefully chosen teaching techniques to tailor a course that meets your individual needs and allows you to achieve your goals effectively.</p>

                <p>As part of my training in Brazilian culture, I will explain Brazilian food, festivals, regional differences, and do's and don'ts in different social contexts. For example, if you park your car in the street and a young boy says he will look after it, what should you do? How easy is it to make friends in Brazil, and what about beach etiquette?</p>

                <p>All my courses start with a free 20-30 minute assessment during which teacher and student discuss the student’s interests, background, and goals so we can decide together on the best route to achieve the best results.</p>

                <p>Courses are flexible: students can choose to focus on speaking skills, or they might prefer working on their reading and writing, or a mix of all skills.</p>

                <p>Location is also flexible: lessons can take place in students' offices, homes, or public places like cafes in London or in parts of Surrey.</p>

                <p>All of these factors will determine the cost of each course. Check the <a href="/prices/">prices</a> page for more information.</p>
