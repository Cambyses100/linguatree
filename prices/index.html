            <h2>Lingua1: One-to-One Lessons</h2>
            <p>The tutor at LinguaTree is happy to organize lessons for small or large groups. Groups can be as small as two students per class or as large as 10+ students per class. The price per person or per group is negotiable depending on the number of students in the class, the length of the course, and the location chosen for the lessons.</p>

            <h2>LinguaGroup: Group Lessons</h2>
            <p>If you are a company that needs to provide your staff with Brazilian Portuguese training, it is possible to organize a course flexible enough to accommodate time constraints and mixed ability levels. One-to-one tuition for specific staff members follows the same pricing as individual lessons, except when very specific or technical language is required. For group lessons, the price per student is negotiable depending on location, course length, and advance payment.</p>

            <h2>LinguaTraining: In-house Training</h2>
            <p>This course helps children become fluent in Brazilian Portuguese or assists Brazilian children living in the UK in maintaining their fluency.</p>

            <p>The LinguaTree tutor is happy to offer one-to-one or small group lessons for children. Whether you are a school or a parent organizing after-school clubs or looking for private Brazilian Portuguese lessons for your children, prices are negotiable. Contact me to arrange private lessons or a Brazilian Portuguese language and culture club tailored to your school.</p>

            <h2>LinguaChild: Brazilian Portuguese for Children and Young Learners</h2>
            <p>One-to-one sessions are the most popular choice among Brazilian Portuguese learners. Prices for individual lessons depend on location, student level, course length, and type. Students are encouraged to take at least 1 hour 30 minutes per session and have lessons as frequently as possible.</p>

            <p>There is a 10% discount for students who choose to pay in advance for a block of at least 10 lessons. This option benefits both tutor and student, ensuring students can follow a regular course for longer.</p>
