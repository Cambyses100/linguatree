            <h2>The Tutor</h2>
            <p>My name is Renata, and I am a Brazilian lawyer with an MA in Linguistics from a UK university. I am a certified TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) teacher and have taught in Brazil, China, and the UK.</p>

            <p>I have a passion for languages and language teaching. I deliver personalized courses to my students so they can achieve their goals through a wide range of informed techniques. These techniques are based on my professional training and my experience teaching students of all ages, nationalities, and levels. I believe that language and culture should be learned together, so my lessons always include insights into some cultural aspects of Brazil.</p>

            <p>Courses are designed around the time each student can dedicate to learning. For busy students, lessons can be short but effective, with regular revisions to ensure retention. For those with more time, lessons are complemented by activities that students can do at home or on the go to maximize their contact with the language.</p>

            <h2>Popular Courses</h2>
            <p>Some popular courses focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Survival Brazilian Portuguese</li>
                <li>Brazilian Portuguese conversation and pronunciation skills</li>
                <li>Preparation for the 2014 Rio World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games</li>
                <li>Brazilian language and culture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students can mix aspects of different courses or add technical elements they need for personal or professional purposes. It's possible to focus on one or more skills, such as listening, speaking, reading, or writing.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>A free initial assessment is provided for new students. This 20-30 minute assessment helps discuss your interests, preferences, level, and linguistic background. The course is then tailored together by the student and tutor.</p>

            <p>You can choose a more informal approach to learning by simply taking lessons and enjoying the process. If you prefer regular assessments, they can be organized periodically to track your progress.</p>

            <p>Assessments are based on the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages" target="_blank">European Framework for Languages</a>, which guides students from level A1 (beginner) to C2 (proficient). I will provide an explanation of what it means to be at each level as you progress.</p>
